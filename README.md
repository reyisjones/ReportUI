# Report UI

This project is an **initial example** for building a **desktop application** using **PyQt6** and **QML**. The purpose of this prototype is to lay the foundation for a future **Report Manager UI**, a tool designed to streamline the creation of **data analysis** and **report generation** workflows using Python.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The current version of the app features a simple desktop UI that displays the current time using QML, and updates it in real time through a Python backend.

This minimal setup serves as a starting point to later expand the application into a robust platform for:

- Interactive report design
- Query-based data analysis
- Execution of Python and PySpark code
- Integration with Jupyter Notebooks for reproducible research

---

## 🎯 Vision for the Report Manager UI

The goal is to build a **data-centric UI platform** where users can:

- Connect to various data sources
- Use different **query languages** (e.g., SQL, KQL, SparkSQL)
- Write and run Python-based scripts and notebooks
- Generate customizable dashboards and reports
- Export results in various formats (PDF, Excel, Markdown)

## 🧪 Current Functionality

- Displays a background image with the current GMT time overlaid.
- The backend is implemented in Python and uses `pyqtSignal` to update the UI via QML bindings.
- A simple threaded clock updates the UI every 100ms.

## ⚙️ Running the Prototype

Make sure you have Python 3 and PyQt6 installed.

```bash
pip install PyQt6
python main.py
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- This is a **work in progress** and intended only as an early prototype.
- More complex features such as data source connectors, visual editors, and notebook integrations will be added incrementally.

## 🤝 Contributing

Future plans include:
- Adding modular panels for query input and results visualization
- Integrating notebook rendering via `nbconvert` or `JupyterLab`
- Creating a plugin system for data adapters
